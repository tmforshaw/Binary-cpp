# Binary C++

# Description
A C++ VS Project where I try to implement binary as a class, implement binary maths and other binary functions.

# What there currently is
* The Binary Class - This allows for the output of binary numbers via std::ostream, and contains getters and setters for the bits as well as the ability to flip all bits.
* The BinaryInt Class - This has mathematical functions (+ - * / %), and boolean operators (== != > >= < <=).

# What I plan to include 
  * Include <ostream> instead of <iostream> where I can.
  * Introduce Floating Point Numbers
  * Input Numbers
  * Input Equations
  
# License
I do not have any professional licenses on this work, you are free to use it however you want. I'd be glad to know where you are using it if you do.
