# Binary C++
A C++ VS Project where I try to implement binary as a class, implement binary maths and other binary functions.


Currently there is:

The Binary Class - This allows for the output of binary numbers via std::ostream, and contains getters and setters for the bits as well as the ability to flip all bits.

The BinaryInt Class - This has mathematical functions (+ - * / %), and boolean operators (== != > >= < <=).
